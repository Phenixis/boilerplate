It's a journey that I, Maxime Duhamel, have been on for the past few years. I learned a lot, failed a lot, had some sleepless nights, and some great moments of joy.

                    <span className="text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">Building an application</span> alone has some advantages. The main advantage is that I can make decisions quickly and implement them even faster. Features shipped in a few hours, bug fixed in a few minutes, support answered in a few seconds. I can move and adapt quickly.

I hope you'll enjoy using {process.env.APP_NAME || '[App]'} as much as I enjoyed building it. Thank you for choosing {process.env.APP_NAME || '[App]'}, thank you for supporting small developpers like me.
